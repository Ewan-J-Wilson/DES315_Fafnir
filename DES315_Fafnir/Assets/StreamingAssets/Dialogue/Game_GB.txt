I'll make this real simple for you, dad. {n}You can move around using {Player/Movement}...
{NEXT}...then {Player/Jump} to jump real high!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
You can also press {Player/Use} to activate certain objects. Try it on that lever there!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Shock]
Press? Lever? What in creation are you talking about, child?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
I have powers far beyond your mortal comprehension, father. Just do it.

[DAD_Shock] 
I...I did it! But why am I back where I started?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Because it didn't happen like that! 
{NEXT}
[DAD_Tired]
*sigh* Okay, then how did it happen?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
That's where the powers the witch gave you come in handy! Duh! 
{NEXT}
[Dad_Neutral]
Ah yes, of course. How do I go about doing that?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
I will forgive your transgressions this once, father. {n}After all, what is a stick without a carrot?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
You can use {Player/Clone} to create a clone of yourself that will copy your actions.
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
But be careful! You're only allowed four of them. That's just the way this world works.
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Okay, but what if I get stuck? {n}Then you'll have to just go to bed before I finish.
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
You wouldn't DARE! But...I see your point. Very well. 
{NEXT}
[Child_Anger]
I suppose I'll allow you correct any mistakes you make along the way. {n}Just press {Player/Reset} and you'll restart the level. Happy?
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Very. Now let's go get that hat!

[CHILD_Happy]
This place is wild!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Why would an entire city be abandoned?
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
I read that some mega-corporation started{n}building it, but then no one wanted to live here.
{NEXT}
[DAD_Tired]
I wonder why...
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
My money's on a government cover-up.
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
What a waste, to build all of this for no reason...
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
At least we get to enjoy the leftovers.
