I'll make this real simple for you, dad. {n}You can move around using {Player/Movement}...
{NEXT}...then {Player/Jump} to jump real high!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
You can also press {Player/Use} to activate certain objects. Try it on that lever there!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Shock]
Press? Lever? What in creation are you talking about, child?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Don't worry about it, dad! Just do it!

[DAD_Shock] 
The drawbridge again? But we already read this part!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Well it was boOoring! It didn't happen like that!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Tired]
*sigh* Okay, then how did it happen?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
The magic book! Duh! {n}What's the point if we don't even use our cool new powers?!
{NEXT}
[Dad_Neutral]
Ah yes, of course. How do I go about doing that?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
I will forgive your transgressions this once, father. {n}After all, what is a stick without a carrot?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
You can use {Player/Clone} to record your actions...
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
...and then press {Player/Clone} again to create a clone of yourself. 
[CHILD_Happy]
The clone will copy everything you did in that time. {n}That includes stuff like using levers, and that button over there!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
But be careful! You're only allowed 4 of them. 
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Why only 4?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Because! That's just the way it works!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Okay, but what if I get stuck? {n}Then you'll have to just go to bed before I finish, and the witch won't get her hat back.
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
That's no faaaair! {n}Ugh, fiiiine. 
{NEXT}
[Child_Anger]
Just press {Player/Reset} and you'll restart the level. Happy?
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Very. Now let's go get that hat!

[CHILD_Happy]
Yay! You made it past the drawbridge! {n}What's next, dad?
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Our brave fisherman continues on his journey and sees... {n}...TWO buttons! {n}And a lever!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
*gasp* How's he gonna beat *this* obstacle? 
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Hmmm...well, let's see what these switches do first, shall we?
END_DIAG

1-1_START
[CHILD_Anger]
That was too easy! You can do better than that!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Tired]
Child, please. It's getting late. 
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
Make it so there's a big hole in the ground with another button!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Shock]
A...a hole? But how? It wasn't there before!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Don't worry about it! It's just magic! {n}The fisherman knows what to do!
END_DIAG

[CHILD_Anger]
Nope! Still too easy! Read it again!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Tired]
*yawn* Okay, but after this, we're moving on to the next puzzle.
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Tired]
Yeah, I'm getting sleepy too. 
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
So you want me to stop here?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Noooo! We haven't even gotten to the dragon yet! {n}I'm awake, promise!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Alright, alright, I'm just teasing. What happens next?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
He runs into more buttons and more doors! {n}He's gotta open ALL of them to get past!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Alright then, let's do this!
END_DIAG

[CHILD_Happy]
Alright, you made it past those evil platforms! What next? 
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
Our fisherman's last obstacle is his greatest opponent yet...
{NEXT}
[DAD_Shock]
...A DASTARDLY SAWFISH!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
Oh man, this is gonna be good! {n}Are they gonna fight?! {n}Will there be lots of blood?! {n}Is the fisherman gonna cook him up for dinner?!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Shock]
Goodness, noooo, nooo, no! He's just...standing there. {n}And a cloud is raining on him to keep him from drying out.
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Tired]
What...what do you mean?
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
He, uhhh, just finished his work for the day, as a carpenter. {n}So he's too tired to move. 
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
What?! BOOOOOOriiiing! {n}This is the last puzzle! He's gotta be trickier than that!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Tired]
You can come up with something, then. {n}*yawn* I'm too tired to think of anything clever. 
END_DIAG

CLONE_DESTROY
[CHILD_Happy]
BOOM! Your clones are gone!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Shock]
W-what? How?
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
The fish is being rained on, right? {n}The clones are weak to water!
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
What a vivid imagination you have, child. {n}I knew you'd come up with something.
END_DIAG

2-1_START
[CHILD_Happy]
Good thinking, dad! {n}But we can do better than that!
[DAD_Tired]
*sigh* How, child? How can we possibly make it better?
[CHILD_Happy]
You've come this far! I'm sure you can do it!
END_DIAG

[CHILD_Happy]
Nope, not good enough! {n}Last one before the dragon though, I promise!
[DAD_Tired]
Good, cause I'm up past *my* bedtime at this point.

CELESTE_01

[CHILD_Happy]
This place is wild!
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
Why would an entire city be abandoned?
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
I read that some mega-corporation started{n}building it, but then no one wanted to live here.
{NEXT}
[DAD_Tired]
I wonder why...
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Anger]
My money's on a government cover-up.
{NEXT}
[DAD_Neutral]
What a waste, to build all of this for no reason...
{NEXT}
[CHILD_Happy]
At least we get to enjoy the leftovers.
